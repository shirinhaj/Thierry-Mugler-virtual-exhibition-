## Project description: 
This project is dedicated to the legendary fashion designer Manfred Thierry Mugler who left us earlier this year like a shooting star, in all his glory. Thierry Mugler was more than a fashion designer and his vision of fashion was more than simple clothes. He was an accomplished artist, photographer, and iconoclast, and this virtual exhibition is dedicated to him.
