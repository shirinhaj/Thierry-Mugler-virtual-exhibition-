# Mugler Project
#Project description: 
This project is dedicated to the legendary fashion designer Manfred Theirry Mugler who left us earlier this year like a shooting star, in all his glory. Thierry Mugler was more than a fashion designer and his vision of fashion was more than simple clothes. He was an accomplished artist, photographer, and iconoclast. 
The shape of the building is inspired by the first-ever gourmet fragrance - Angle, by Theirry Mugler. Angel’s revolutionary character is due to the original design of the bottle in the form of a star.  The space is separated into 5 areas, which are used to present his career as a fashion designer, the perfume, his iconic collections, photography, and custom design, creating varying atmospheres that personify the numerous projects Mugler has championed since the end of the 1970s.  
Through this virtual exhibition, we hope the audience can rediscover the brilliance of Manfred Theirry Mugler– an artist who marked his time by revolutionizing the world of fashion.
